# Data Augmentation

Data Augmentation is a technique to generate more data to train on. This is particularly effective during a specific classification problem. For instance finger print recognition. 

You can do:

- Translation / shifting
- Cropping
- Scaling
- Rotating
- Flipping
- Adding noise 
- ...

You have to think about if this makes sense. For instance flipping does not make sense when you try to recognize written characters.
